# Project Overview

## Ideas

An app that checks in with users who are struggling with mental health, addiction, or similar challenges at intervals throughout the day. It uses **sentiment analysis** and **CBT Therapy** to detect if a user is in crisis and can reach out to a **user-defined support team**.

## Problem Statement

When people are in crisis, they often don’t reach out for help.

## Product Concept

AI is applied during chats with the user. The goal is to **replace negative thoughts with more realistic and rational ones**, which can lead to:

* Improved mood and emotional regulation
* Reinforcement of positive behavior
